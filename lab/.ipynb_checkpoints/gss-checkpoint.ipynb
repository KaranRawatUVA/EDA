    "The General Social Survey (GSS) is a bi-annual nationally representative survey of Americans, with almost 7000 different questions asked since the survey began in the 1970s. It has straightforward questions about respondents' demographic information, but also questions like \"Does your job regularly require you to perform repetitive or forceful hand movements or involve awkward postures?\" or \"How often do the demands of your job interfere with your family life?\" There are a variety of controversial questions. No matter what you're curious about, there's something interesting in here to check out. The codebook is 904 pages (use CTRL+F to search it).\n",

    "The data and codebook are available at:\n",
    "https://gss.norc.org/us/en/gss/get-the-data.html\n",

    "The datasets are so large that it might make sense to pick the variables you want, and then download just those variables from:\n",
    "https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/variables/vfilter\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is your task:\n",
    "1. Download a small (5-15) set of variables of interest.\n",
    "2. Write a short description of the data you chose, and why. (1 page)\n",
    "3. Load the data using Pandas. Clean them up for EDA. Do this in a notebook with comments or markdown chunks explaining your choices.\n",
    "4. Produce some numeric summaries and visualizations. (1-3 pages)\n",
    "5. Describe your findings in 1-2 pages.\n",
    "6. If you have other content that you think absolutely must be included, you can include it in an appendix of any length.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might want to look at how aspects of a person's childhood family are correlated or not with their career or family choices as an adult. Or how political or religious affiliations correlate with drug use or sexual practices. It's an extremely wide-ranging survey.\n",

    "# 2: Explain Why I chose Data\n",
    "\n",
    "year: I chose this because I wanted to see how mindsets and beliefs changed over the past 50 years. <br>\n",
    "id_: This was to give each response a unique identifer. <br>\n",
    "wrkstat: I chose this variable just in case I wanted to see how working status has changed over time. <br>\n",
    "marital: I was interested in seeing marital patterns over differnt groups. <br>\n",
    "divorce: I wanted to see divorce patterns over different groups, specifcally race. <br>\n",
    "age: I wanted to use age mostly as a filter as some variables (like marital status) matter more at certain ages.\n",
    "educ: I chose this variable because I was interested on how level of education impacts different view points and other variables. <br>\n",
    "sex: I chose sex because I wanted to see how the work status of different genders have changed. As well as other view points such as party. <br>\n",
    "race: I chose race because I wanted to see each variable changes with each different race. It will help me try to uncover societal restrictions. <br>\n",
    "homepop: I chose homepop because I want to if different groups of people have more people in their house. I know certain cultures believe in a multigenerational house holds.<br>\n",
    "partyid: This variable is one of the most interesting to me as I want to see how a person's political party impacts their view, also what groups are more likely to be a certain party. <br>\n",
    "spkrac: I chose this variable because I was interested to see what groups are ok with racists speaking in their neighborhood. There is no variable for holding racist tendencies, but this variable would help me see which groups are ok with racists. I also wanted to see how this changes over time. <br>\n",
    "spkhomo: I chose the variable spkhomo due to similar reasons as spkrac. I wanted to see what groups are ok with a \"homosexual\" speaking in their neighborhood. It is a good indication of LGBTQ+ acceptence. <br>\n",
    "relig: I chose relig because it would be intersting to see how different religions have different view points and behavior. I would like to graph religion with most of the variables in the chart.<br>\n",
    "ballot: this variable came with the data set and will be dropped. "
